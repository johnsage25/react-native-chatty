# Customizing Logic

React native is heavily customizable, as it needs to fit for every user.

As React Native Chatty is built with TypeScript, with help of your IDE autocompletion you will likely see the customization options on each prop.

## Logic
Each section has it's own styles that you can override.

* To customize footer -> footerProps -> containerStyle etc..
* To customize header -> headerProps -> containerStyle etc..
* To customize bubble -> bubbleProps -> containerStyle etc..
